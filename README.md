# Hi, I'm Sambit Chakraborty.

This is my personal website. I'm a software engineer and a Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology from the [Narula Institute of Technology](https://www.nit.ac.in), Kolkata.

### What's the technology stack behind this website?
- [Reflex](https://reflex.dev):
  - this  website is built using Reflex, a progressive web app framework in Python.
  - using this framework, I can write the frontend and backend code in Python.
  - The frontend python code is cross-compiled to React and Chakra UI Components, making it highly performant and customizable.
  - The backend python code is compiled to relevant fastAPI endpoints making it easy to write and maintain, also making the website routing fast and efficient.
